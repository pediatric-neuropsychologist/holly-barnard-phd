            I became a neuropsychologist because, like many others, I had a
            loved one who suffered a brain injury due to medical complications
            and later experienced developmental delays.

            After watching my family members struggle to find a single person
            who could bring all the information together and help our family
            find a path forward, I decided to dedicate myself to becoming that
            person.
