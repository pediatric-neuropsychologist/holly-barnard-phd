        <h1 class="my-4">Additional Services</h1>
        <p>All additional psychologist services provided by Dr. Barnard, consultation (e.g., IEP meeting attendance), therapy, and teaching, are billed at an hourly rate of $250/hour, including travel. An initial deposit of $250 will be due at the time of the Diagnostic Interview and will be applied towards the cost of the full evaluation. The balance of the evaluation fee will be due at the time of testing. Dr. Barnard accepts checks and credit card payments.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-6">Insurance</h2>
        <p>In order to provide patients and their families with the attention and care they deserve, as well as the freedom to fully explore all diagnoses that may be impacting the patient, Dr. Barnard does not bill insurance companies directly and she is not on any insurance panels.</p>
        <p>If you plan to submit for reimbursement, please contact your insurance company to get information about your plan's benefits. Dr. Barnard can provide a statement for out-of-network submission.</p>
