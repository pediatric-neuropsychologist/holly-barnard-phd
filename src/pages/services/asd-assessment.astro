      <p class="mb-4">
        Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors. The spectrum nature means that symptoms and their severity can vary widely from person to person.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Early identification and intervention can significantly improve outcomes. Our comprehensive assessments help clarify diagnosis and provide the foundation for appropriate supports and interventions.
