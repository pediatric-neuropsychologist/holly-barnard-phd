          <p class="fs-5">
            Interestingly, any adults who are looking for assessments related to
            developmental issues (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorders, Learning
            Disorders) would come to see a Pediatric Neuropsychologist to
            explore those questions. However, the typical patient Dr. Barnard
            would see ranges in age from 3 to 22 years old.

          <h1 class="my-3">Do you offer payment plans?</h1>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Full payment is due at the time of service. Dr. Barnard does not
            bill insurance directly and is not on any insurance panels; however,
            she is able to provide a superbill which documents services rendered
            and can be used to obtain out-of-network benefits for
            psychological/neuropsychological testing from your insurance
            company.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5">
            An initial deposit of $200 will be due at the time of the Diagnostic
            Interview. 50% of the remaining balance will be due on the day of
            Diagnostic Testing, and the final 50% will be due at the time of the
            Feedback Session. Additional services (e.g., IEP meeting attendance,
            consultation, therapy, etc.) will be billed at an hourly rate of
            $200. Dr. Barnard accepts Zelle, checks, and credit card payments.
            An additional fee will be assessed for credit card transactions.

          <p class="fs-5">
            Dr. Barnard does not require a referral to book an appointment,
            however a brief phone or e-mail consultation will be conducted prior
            to scheduling to determine if the practice is a good fit for your
            child. If you are planning to submit for out-of-network benefits to
            your insurance provider, please contact them to determine your
            coverage and whether a referral is necessary.

          <h1 class="my-3">What can I expect during the evaluation??</h1>
          <p class="fs-5">
            The total evaluation process, including The Diagnostic Interview,
            Testing, and Feedback typically lasts between four (4) and eight (8)
            face-time hours (with additional hours billed behind the scenes for
            scoring, interpretation, and report writing), depending on the
            complexity of the presenting concerns. The Diagnostic Interview and
            Feedback are one hour each, and testing can last up to the length of
            a full school day (with an included lunch break). Patients and
            parents should expect to take time off from school/work, and parents
            are required to remain on site during testing. Testing is a
            personalized experience during which the patient and their family
            spend the day at Dr. Barnardâ€™s office, and testing is completed,
            scored, and interpreted by Dr. Barnard herself.

          <h1 class="my-3">Do you take therapy patients?</h1>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Dr. Barnard is highly trained in a variety of child- and
            adolescent-focused therapy modalities; however, her practice is
            focused primarily on diagnostics and treatment planning. She will
            consider and possibly take on therapy patients for brief courses
            therapy on a case-by-case basis. If, following your evaluation, you
            wish to pursue treatment with Dr. Barnard, please feel free to
            discuss all of your treatment options at the Feedback Session.
